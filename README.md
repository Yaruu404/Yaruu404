- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m @Yaruu404: a student of the arts of developing software. Iâ€™m interested in back-end development, hardware in general and music.
- Yes, I love music as much as I love coding. I began my studies of technology and programming with Python 3.9, and I'm currently learning about web development (HTML, CSS and JS). I also love video-games, and have a strong will (/wish) to learn C languages (C, C++, C#) to work with Unity ~even though I don't currently have the necessary hardware~

- Anyone can reach me through my work e-mail oliveira.oquendo01@gmail.com
